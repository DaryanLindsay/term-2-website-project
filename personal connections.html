<h1>Personal Connections</h1>

<p>I started playing Clash of Clans several years ago and ever since I started playing I knew I would love the game. I have many great memories of my friends and I playing Clash of Clans together. It was always fun to make a clan together. I have also learned some important lessons like to not trust some people with too much power. I learned this lesson because I promoted Lyndon to co-leader of my clan and he kicked evryone one out who was a lower rank than him. I remember being really excited when clan wars were added to the game.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Clash of Clans is one of my favourite games because I enjoy all the strategies that you can create. I love how their arent many rules of the game and you can pretty much do whatever you want. I also love how players can work cooperatively together but you always have to worry about attacks, betrayal, and when your clan goes to war.</p>
