<h1>Game Play</h1>
<h3>The Start</h3>
<img class="text" src="clash1.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>When the game starts you are given a plot of land with a Town Hall one. You are made chief of this village and are given absolute athoruity over it. However, dark forces lurk beyond the walls of village. This becomes evident when your village is attacked by goblins and all you have to defend it is a level one canon. After you are victorious, you can get revenge on the goblins by leading an attack on one of their villages.</p>

<h3>War for Power</h3>

<p>After you complete the tutorial, you are free to do whatever you want. You can upgrade you base with gold and elixer.Because of this there is an endless war for control of the resources. Once you have gold and elixer you can uprade you defences to make your base stringer against attacks, or upgrade your army so you can attack stronger bases. Once you have collected enough money, you can pay to rebluid your clan castle. When you have a Clan Castle, you can join clans, which are alliances with other village chiefs. In a clan you can communicate with eachother, donate troops to eachother, and declare war on other clans together. </p>
